## Currencylayer API key

JetCurrency uses the [Currencylayer](https://currencylayer.com) to load exchange rate data.
To use the API, you will need to obtain a free developer API key. See the
[Currencylayer API Documentation](https://currencylayer.com/documentation) for instructions.

Once you have the key, add this line to the `gradle.properties` file, either in your user home
directory (usually `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` on Linux and Mac) or in the project's root folder:

```
currencylayer_access_key=<your Currencylayer access key>
```
